      <h2>About Me</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hi there, I am so glad you are here. So a little bit about my background. <br>
      I started my journey in coding back in 2020, but because life was playing <br>
      a trick with me, I had to stop and pursued my jouney in photography instead <br>
      (what I am also passionate about). Do you want to why? Part of being adult is <br>
      that you have responsilibities, doing photography helped me earn quick income <br>
      to help support my family. However, I finally had the time to take a break from <br>
      working and I could finally started to focus on learning to code from scratch. <br>
      So I started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from Web Developerment Bootcamp <br>
      on Udemy. In fact, when I was in Middle School I was introduced to HTML in my <br>
      computer class. I remembered I enjoyed coding during class so much. Learning to <br>
      build my first website was very fun and challenging. So my goal is to build beautiful <br>
      and functional websites for others to use. Isn't it so sartisfied? when people admire <br>
      your work that you have built all by yourself.
